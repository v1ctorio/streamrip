## Installation

First, ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.10 or greater) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) are installed. Then install `ffmpeg`. You may choose not to install this, but some functionality will be limited.

```bash
pip3 install streamrip --upgrade
```

When you type

```bash
rip
```

it should show the main help page. If you have no idea what these mean, or are having other issues installing, check out the [detailed installation instructions](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/wiki#detailed-installation-instructions).

For Arch Linux users, an AUR package exists. Make sure to install required packages from the AUR before using `makepkg` or use an AUR helper to automatically resolve them.
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/streamrip.git
cd streamrip
makepkg -si
```
 or
 ```
paru -S streamrip
```

### Streamrip beta

If you want to get access to the latest and greatest features without waiting for a new release, install
from the `dev` branch with the following command

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/nathom/streamrip.git@dev
```

## Example Usage

**For Tidal and Qobuz, you NEED a premium subscription.**

Download an album from Qobuz

```bash
rip url https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/album/rumours-fleetwood-mac/0603497941032
```

Download multiple albums from Qobuz

```bash
rip url https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/album/back-in-black-ac-dc/0886444889841 https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/album/blue-train-john-coltrane/0060253764852
```

Download the album and convert it to `mp3`

```bash
rip --codec mp3 url https://open.qobuz.com/album/0060253780968
```

To set the maximum quality, use the `--quality` option to `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`:

| Quality ID | Audio Quality         | Available Sources                            |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | 128 kbps MP3 or AAC   | Deezer, Tidal, SoundCloud (most of the time) |
| 1          | 320 kbps MP3 or AAC   | Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, SoundCloud (rarely)    |
| 2          | 16 bit, 44.1 kHz (CD) | Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, SoundCloud (rarely)    |
| 3          | 24 bit, ≤ 96 kHz      | Tidal (MQA), Qobuz, SoundCloud (rarely)      |
| 4          | 24 bit, ≤ 192 kHz     | Qobuz                                        |

```bash
rip --quality 3 url https://tidal.com/browse/album/147569387
```

> Using `4` is generally a waste of space. It is impossible for humans to perceive the difference between sampling rates higher than 44.1 kHz. It may be useful if you're processing/slowing down the audio.

Search for playlists matching `rap` on Tidal

```bash
rip search tidal playlist 'rap'
```

![streamrip interactive search](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/blob/dev/demo/playlist_search.png?raw=true)

Search for *Rumours* on Tidal, and download it

```bash
rip search tidal album 'fleetwood mac rumours'
```

Download a last.fm playlist using the lastfm command

```
rip lastfm https://www.last.fm/user/nathan3895/playlists/12126195
```

For more customization, see the config file

```
rip config open
```

If you're confused about anything, see the help pages. The main help pages can be accessed by typing `rip` by itself in the command line. The help pages for each command can be accessed with the `--help` flag. For example, to see the help page for the `url` command, type

```
rip url --help
```
